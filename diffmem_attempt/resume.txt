===============================WARNING!==============================================
1. project is not building upon Mac OS bacause of src defect
2. only one successful build represented here is for ubuntu 18.04. Didn't manage to build upon 16.04 but don't have proof that's impossible.
If you want to be brave and discover - try it yourself
3. Example represented here is theo.saemix data from R Saemix library
4. Work is taking very long to converge
==============SAEN took 421.4109547138214==============

Disadvantages of the project

2. No documentation
3. You have need to write new models in cpp
